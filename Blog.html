					<img src="socialtech.jpeg" height="334px" width="405px">
					<p >The advancement of technology has impacted tremendously to the human life having its own pros and cons. The major negative factor being the effects on social life, how a person is stuck on a screen rather than the having a social life like in the past decades. Specially to the growing up children or teenagers whose social life reflect from their life on social media. Technology like the Internet, has the motto to bind families, friends together who are far from each other and connection between them seems limited up to their only. It is isolating a person to staying on computer and trust technology than themselves. It has also increased lack of privacy and identity theft which is an example of misusing the technology. Addiction of using the technology is making human beings dependent on it and not putting efforts on their own to solve problems themselves. The technology has been a basic need for an individual which is good but overuse of anything is not good at all.</p>

					<h2 style="text-align: center; " >Effect on Education</h2>
					<img src="blog4.jpg" height="334px" width="425px">
					<p>Education is a vital part of an individuals life and without education is like a bird without wings. The role of technology is developing on education but hasn't reached it full potential, education sector are still lacking on technology on some countries. Technology helps on adaptive learning at a different rate and absorbs information uniquely where students learn at their own pace. It has also increased participation by making the environment and curriculum interesting and fun by using slides, videos,etc. to demonstrate the context. But it is also distracting the students from the freedom of technology as well as giving them too much screen time which may not be a good thing. Video games, Internet has been a major need for people leading them to communicating better in the virtual world then interaction in person. The technology has been a platform where a students creativity hides under the uses of technology making their potential unused and they are left without gaining or knowing their true potential which education is thought to discover. </p>

			<p style="margin-bottom: 20px; ">With all of these said, it is time to answer that one important question: does technology do more harm then good? The answer lies on scale of time you are looking at. Because of its advantages, technology serves us well at this point in time. However, it might not be too long before we pay the price.<br><br>
