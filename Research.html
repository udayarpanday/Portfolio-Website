	<p> Inspiration is very essential for a content creator to boost one's ability of making a creative design by admiring the ideas of a professional and to put their effort and hardworking to make  a unique content.</p> 
	<p>Some of the ideas that I have inherited from other website are listed below comparing with my design. </p>
	<table border="0" width="85%" align="center">
			<tr> 
				<th colspan="2" align="left" style="color: #FF5A09;"><h3> 1. Shrink Navigation Bar</h3></th>
			</tr>
			<tr class="tableimg">
				<td ><img src="shrinknavbar1.png"></td>
				<td><img src="shrinknavbar2.png"></td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td align="center" colspan="2">
					<p>Since navigation bar is one of the most important feature of an website I had to be precise of my choice and choosing a shrinking navigation bar seemed a good idea for me. I took idea from this website and make a simple modification by changing the padding of text so it would appear near the center which then on scroll using javascript again moves to the edge. The use of hero image portrays a huge image with a strong text which grabs the attention. This website inspired me to use the hero image as it was clear and bold displaying a some information of the creator as soon as you open the site.   </p>

				<th colspan="2" align="left" style="color: #FF5A09;"><h3> 2. Design for CV</h3></th>

			<tr class="tableimg">
				<td ><img src="cvdesign1.png"></td>
				<td><img src="cvdesign2.png"></td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td align="center" colspan="2">
					<p>Being a portfolio website this page was really important and had to be perfect. For I had to do a lot of research and the design for a cv page online was limited. Simple description was given with reference of the website as it seemed quite professional and simple in it's own way. </p>
				</td>
			</tr>
			<tr> 
				<th colspan="2" align="left" style="color: #FF5A09;"><h3> 3. Timeline </h3></th>
			</tr>
			<tr class="tableimg">
				<td ><img src="timeline1.png"></td>
				<td><img src="timeline2.png"></td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td align="center" colspan="2">
					<p> Curriculum Vitae is where is an overview of an individual introduction, qualification and experience. So to show case my qualification and skills I took this site as reference which describes them using timeline and skill bar which is very informative and represents all the aspects.</p>

			<tr> 
				<th colspan="2" align="left" style="color: #FF5A09;"><h3> 4. Image Slider</h3></th>
			</tr>
			<tr class="tableimg">
				<td ><img src="slider1.png"></td>
				<td><img src="slider2.png"></td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td align="center" colspan="2">
					<p>The portfolio website needs a complete picture description of the individual's or the examples of their work. Since lacking in projects and experiences I had decides to add my pictures of my hobbies, passion and my lifestyle. For this is used the help of an image slider which was perfect fit for my website and the idea was generated from the referenced website. </p>

			</tr>
			<tr> 
				<th colspan="2" align="left" style="color: #FF5A09;"><h3> 5. Contact Page</h3></th>
			</tr>
			<tr class="tableimg">
				<td ><img src="contact1.png"></td>
				<td><img src="contact2.png"></td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td align="center" colspan="2">
					<p>The last page is the contact page which consists of a form and being the last page I needed to be creative but not that I over do it. So while keeping things simple taking the reference of this site i also added a background to match my gray and orange color theme. </p>
